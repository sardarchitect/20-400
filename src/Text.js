  `Q. What is the problem you're trying to solve? *`,

  `This project started through an observation  that certain problems around the world such as overpopulation, climate change, political strife , nuclear threat, and the increasing economic gap, are swiftly reaching a breaking point. No previous generation has quite faced these large-scale, existential threats that not only affect our own species, but also this planet at large.`,

  `We believe that before anyone can even start caring about an issue, they need to first understand the context through a variety of scales and lenses. However, the news media that everyday people rely on to stay informed about these issues are becoming increasingly biased and sensationalized. There is little attention given to the details of the issue, let alone the reporting of solutions to these large-scale problems. Stories appear the day they occurred as a devastating tragedy, but that attention is gone the next day as it is drawn to other issues.`,

  `What Seek2Solve strives to achieve is the reorganization, reprioritization, and visualization of information regarding world issues, so that everyday citizens can have as much of an equitable insight as academic researchers have into them.`,

  `Q. Describe the project that you're working on to address this problem *`,

  `After identifying the problem, our team realized that there are already groups and organizations doing the hard work of addressing and alleviating some of these issues. The organizations, including nonprofits and charities, are reliant on resources that sustain their operations through volunteers and donors. Through multiple interviews with local Ann Arbor nonprofits and people at the University, we realized that our generation is increasingly disengaged with these organizations.`,

  `From these interviews, we concluded that to address the broader problem, we need to bring the existing infrastructure of nonprofits to the cultural zeitgeist of our generation. Seek2Solve strives to not only educate people on social issues, but also create a direct channel to organizations and nonprofits. Throughout optiMize, we refined our platform down to the two words that make up the platform’s brand:`,
  `Seek helps users to identify the scale and context of important, urgent issues going on around the world in a easy-to-understand filtration process. It allows users to see the problem through multiple ways: visual trend graphs, short descriptions, and chronological news articles.`,

  `Solve gives users the ability to take action. By associating efficient groups and organizations to the issues, Solve helps people to get directly involved with the solution (through multiple ways of engagement). To help users decide which nonprofits they would like to support , Solve shows rankings of nonprofits based on different, credible watchdog groups, and tries to promote those that need the most public attention. `,

  `Q. Please describe the prototype that you created.`,

  `Our optiMize prototype currently consists of wireframes of both the Seek and the Solve aspects of our platform. The wireframes currently showcase the the steps a user would take to navigate Seek2Solve.`,

  `Our goal with the wireframes was to help our stakeholders visualize the ways Seek2Solve would take its users through the filtration process toward a nonprofit that they could directly contribute to. Below are some highlights: `,

  `Seek2Solve filters down world problems by focusing on one country or region at a time. 
    It then allows users to view 15 carefully curated issue-categories (each scaled according to the urgency of that issue), specific to that region.`,

  `Users are then able to view specific issues within the broader categories, along with nonprofits, working within that region, fighting to solve those problems.`,
  `In addition to the above steps, there are also aspects like news, educational articles, and dynamic search that further enhance the user experience.`,

  `Q. Who did you test the prototype with, and how? *`,
  `We tested our conceptual prototype with multiple stakeholders, starting first with local Ann Arbor nonprofits. We personally interviewed around 10 local nonprofits to not only understand the space we are working in, but also gain insight of their exact needs. By having them explain their fundraising and community outreach processes, we were able to find enough commonalities between all of these NPOs in order to understand what features would be appreciated by these often understaffed organizations that are largely disconnected from the general public.`,

  `Additionally, we reached out to friends and relatives, along with those in the optiMize community (about 130 people in total) to ask them about their own experiences with world issues and nonprofits in their everyday lives. We mostly did in-person/ phone interviews (about 30-40 mins each), and discussed their perspectives on how the media reports current events, along with their thoughts on nonprofits in general to better understand how best to build the bridge between these two groups.`,

  `We will be soon reaching out to faculty in certain UM Departments who work within the public/ voluntary sector, to further our understanding of the space.`,

  `Q. How did you implement the feedback you received from your prototype testing?`,
  `
    All throughout our project development, we were fortunate to receive helpful feedback from optiMize staff, nonprofits, and potential general public users such as fellow optiMizers, as well as our friends and relatives who helped spread our surveys. `,
  `Although the optiMize staff all possessed expertise in different fields, all were approachable and helpful as they guided us to discover what the “selling point” of Seek2Solve was, which helped us hone our platform features in a manner that rendered razor-sharp focus to this point, as well as differentiating us from other competitor apps. In addition, we were continually challenged to define the ”space” we are operating within, and define our target community. After we finally concluded this to be socially-aware individuals in our generation, we were able to further develop features that would appeal to younger people in our society, so that they would seek and, most importantly, be compelled to solve issues.`,

  `Another group that we consulted heavily for advice was the nonprofit organizations. The feedback from nonprofits helped us understand just what it takes to sustain a socially-oriented organization, whose biggest goal is serving the general public but are largely ignored by THEIR target group. Talking with these heroes-without-capes motivated our team to bring our project to fruition in hopes of bringing tangible changes, such as increasing exposure and bringing volunteers to them.`,

  `The final phase of our feedback-seeking focused on our potential general public users. We were fortunate to receive over 100 responses on our latest survey, from which we used the feedback to conduct further research on user engagement for online applications and set what we learned into motion by designing new features that would encourage long-term engagement with the app.`,

  `Q. How is your work creating value for others? *`,

  `Nonprofits and organizations who are working on urgent global issues will not only have a method to establish their online presence, an aspect that nonprofits that we interviewed, are severely lacking in, but they will also have access to an additional donation source. Their increased visibility in the public sphere will help them promote their cause, and the general public can finally help the nonprofits help cultivate efficient solutions for social issues.`,

  `For the socially-engaged individual, Seek2Solve will be a platform that reduces the noise in mass media and helps focus attention to those specific causes that may need the most contributors. By promoting nonprofits based not only on the issues they are working in, but also efficiency, Seek2Solve will enable donors to choose the nonprofits where their financial contributions would have the most bang for their buck.`,

  `In addition to nonprofits and individual contributors, Seek2Solve’s main stakeholders are the people and communities who are suffering due to these world issues. We believe that with focused attention and resources, under-served communities and groups would truly be the main beneficiary.`,

  `Q. In what ways have you built support for your work so far? *`,
  `Within optiMize, friends, family, user interviews, local nonprofits - all confirming our hypothesis and solution`,
  `Initially, the support for our work came solely through our team’s desire to learn about instigating positive change at a large scale, and try to find a point of entry for our specific skill sets and passions. Not long after the development of Seek2Solve’s driving concept, we quickly accrued support from the nonprofits and people we engaged with`,

  `Given our narrow understanding of world problems, information flow, nonprofits, and the general perception towards public service, we decided it would be in our best interest to reach out to these associated stakeholders. We were granted many opportunities to speak directly with various nonprofit faculty, with not only the intent to learn from them, but to gauge how our platform might improve and transform their operations. Additionally, we conducted surveys that we distributed through our immediate social & professional circles that aimed to evoke insight into how a typical person might think and feel about world problems, nonprofits, and volunteer efforts. These surveys allowed us even more opportunities to refine our concept, as we were approached by numerous follow-up interviews with some highly-engaged respondents. 
    It is thanks to these efforts that we were able to develop the understanding necessary to state our project’s mission with confidence. Not only had we elicited a clearer idea of how our stakeholders perceive the problem, but we also created relationships through which we can foster in hopes of future engagement. `,

  `Q. Tell us about the “space” you’re operating in, and your relationships with key players, stakeholders, community partners, and other organizations. * What have you learned, how are you connected, what's important about these relationships to your project?`,

  `The space we are operating in is quite multi-faceted, as Seek2Solve is an amalgamation of a social engagement, data-aggregation, and visualization platform. Though generally speaking, we belong to the public service sector, we are also in the online search & crowdfunding industry.
    One aspect we value within the public service portion of our project, are the relationships that we have formed with charities and nonprofits around Ann Arbor, who have given us great insight into their world. These nonprofits have shown interest in continuing to form this relationship as we continue to develop further. We plan to prioritize fostering these local nonprofit relationships, as we are considering starting within the region, and growing from there on. Another aspect of the public service sector worthy of praise are the contributors and volunteers: people who are, or show interest in becoming, engaged and globally conscious citizens. These users are not only a critical resource for nonprofit operation, but we have identified them as our initial target audience.`,

  `Within the technology aspect of our space, we have established an understanding of key organizations and groups who have a similar vision like ours. We will be using databases of GuideStar, Charity Navigator, and Charity Watch. We will also be relying on data from Google Trends, and Our World In Data. We plan to start contacting other think-tank groups like HODAI, 80,000 Hours, and Global Issues Network, who all are within our space trying to focus people’s attentions to urgent world issues.`,

  `Q. What is innovative about your work? How do you relate to other existing options in the "space" you're operating in? * Note: "Innovative" does not necessarily mean "never been done before in any location." Sometimes innovation can include using existing models to address a need that persists in a specific area.
    `,
  `
    Within our space, our market competitors are crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe, Facebook Donations, PayPal Giving, etc. While these platforms do indeed have a way to connect donors to nonprofits, their searches prioritize popularity and do not properly inform a given user of the issue’s context. As a result, issues that are large in scale and are deeply rooted but fail to maintain prolonged public awareness, simply disappear into obscurity. In essence, there are currently no platforms for the layman to grasp the bigger picture of world issues, let alone to help.`,
  `Seek2Solve fulfills that need by providing people a platform to compare the scales of these existing problems through visualized data-aggregation, as well as supplying a direct means through which people can help. The data used to visualize world issues will be sourced from credible research organizations such as 80,000 Hours, UN Global Issues Overview, Global Issues Network, and more. `,
  `
    While other platforms promote personal fundraisers to, for example, pay for an individual’s education or to commemorate the death of a loved one, our team believes that larger-scaled issues can, and ought to be, displayed on a platform separate from these social issues. As a result, Seek2Solve directs people to those organizations which are working on pressing issues that affect the masses such as poverty, climate change, and war refugees.`,

  `Q. What is your vision for the impact you want to make? *`,
  `
    
    We hope to reshape the understanding of nonprofits and world issues in order to make public service central in our ever-evolving culture. Our team aims to create a medium for any individual person to be able to make a positive impact on the world and contribute to solving major issues. We want to decrease the feeling of helplessness much of the general public feels when they are presented with a problem occurring in the world and do not know how to help address it, and we also want to provide an accessible, comprehensive overview of what such issues are and what they connect to in terms of their causes and effects. We hope people will grow to have a better understanding of what non-profit organizations do, and they will start working with them more to help make a difference. `,

  `Q. What activities do you need to do to create this impact? *`,

  `To create our impact, we will be developing an app and have several tasks we intend to accomplish for this purpose. We are breaking up our timeline into phases that are dependent on what we need to learn and develop. During March and April, we will focus on forming key partnerships with members of the University of Michigan who share a similar vision to ours, such as the Global Scholars Program, the Center for Socially Engaged Design, and Tech for Social Good. We will also distribute more surveys and conduct more in-person interviews to gain further information about the needs of the community and the app’s most useful features. We plan on creating a second prototype that will include our app’s quintessential features. We will also practice making simple apps through tutorials in order to gain some exposure to app development and then, starting in summer, we will learn more in-depth aspects of development and begin creating Seek2Solve. Focus groups will be formed throughout the process and we will arrange these sessions with students around U-M. In August, we intend to have our MVP ready for beta testing and will recruit users around campus. By the end of August, we will deploy our app on the app stores and begin the process again of designing, testing, refining, and developing so we can move forward into adding new features to our app and expanding the platform.`,

  `Q. What resources do you need to do these activities?`,

  `We will need to learn more about app development and will be utilizing courses on Udemy and Coursera to do so. For specific tools used for creating our app, we will need a hosting service, React Native, a database, and a web scraper. We will be meeting with an app developer in order to learn more about the tools we are accessing and what else will be required to code the app. We will also be scheduling focus group sessions and will provide incentives to recruit people for these sessions. Alongside this, we will consult with a UI/UX designer to discuss how to best design the features and we will utilize their knowledge in understanding and implementing the feedback we receive from our focus group sessions. Towards the end of summer, we will find beta testers and provide incentives for them as well, and then after fixing any issues, we will submit our app to the Apple app store and Google play store. In addition, we will be looking to advertise our app in order to build a larger user base and will use traditional flyers as well as advertising services through existing platforms. Throughout all this, we would be trying to connect Seek2Solve with research partnerships within the University. Our next steps are to look for data-analysts, public-policy and global-issues researchers, and student organizations.`,

  `Q. Where will you be working this summer? (If you're not going to be in Ann Arbor, please explain why being in a different city is advantageous for your project.) *`,

  `We will all be working in Ann Arbor.`,

  `Q. How is your team working to minimize the cost of your project?`,
  `
    Our team has been proactive about asking people within and outside optiMize on ways to cut project development costs. We are minimizing costs through planning to use a single Udemy and Coursera account for online tutorials during our learning phase. We are also trying to use low-cost/ open-source options wherever we can in the development of the app. For example, we decided to use React Native, a front-end development framework that is significantly cheaper than platform-specific tools, with all the functionalities necessary to create the features a Seek2Solve user would want. The largest area where we are minimizing costs is that we will be learning app development by ourselves, and working on it together. The costs we have included for consultation will be only used during certain checkpoints in the development phase, specifically for feedback/ solutions.
